## Overview

This lightweight dashboard collects the visual outputs and a link to the rendered PDF for Module 1 (tabular data / CO2 stressors). The plots shown below were generated by `example2.qmd` and saved in the repository as PNGs.

## Top 5 CO2 Emitters — Time Series

## Notes

- The plots are included as static images saved in the repository.
- If you want an interactive dashboard (filters, reactive plots), I can convert this into a small Shiny app or use plotly to make the plots interactive; tell me which you prefer.
